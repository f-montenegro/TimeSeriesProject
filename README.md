# Time Series Project (ENSAE - 2019/2020)


In this project, we are interested in the modeling and forecasting of the industrial production index corrected for seasonal variations and working days (CSV-CWD). The series used makes it possible to follow the monthly evolution of the CSV-CWD Index of industrial production (base 100) of natural gas extraction, item 06.2 according to the NAF classification, between July 2007 and September 2013 and includes therefore 159 observations.

The project is divided into 3 parts:

   - Part I: Data analysis and transformation to make the time series stationary;
   - Part II: ARMA modeling for the corrected time series (parameter estimation);
   - Part III: Forecast assuming that the residuals of the series are Gaussian.

In this Git directory, you will find:
   - The dataset used (data/monthly_values.csv);
   - The code in R (main_ts_project.R);
   - The project report in french (report/Report_TimeSeriesProject.pdf).
